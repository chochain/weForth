# weForth - Web eForth with WASM

WebAssembly enpowered eForth on web browsers. Is it faster? Is it more portable? Yes, and Yes.

Well, on my aged laptop, the impression is pretty exciting! It's at least 5x faster than pure Javascript implementation on a browser and at 60% speed of C/C++ natively compiled code on CPU. It was at 25% of native a year ago but as Javascript JIT improves, it now runs faster as well. Not bad at all! On the portability end, though not exactly plug-and-play but some simple alteration turned my C code web-enabled. Of course, WASM has yet to integrate with the front-end well enough, so updating DOM is a different feat. If we want to venture beyond being a terminal app some UI glue is still required.

Regardless, it brought me warm smiles seeing eForth run in a browser. Better yet, it's straight from C/C++ source code. Other popular scripting languages such as Python, Ruby are trending toward WASM/WASI implementation as well. However, unlike FORTH, they depend mostly on JIT without a built-in compiler, the interpreter-in-an-interpreter design will likely cap the top-end performance (i.e. stuck at 10~15% of native speed, so far).

With WASM, the interoperability between different languages become a thing of the near future. If words can be compiled directly into WASM opcodes, OS and peripherals can be accessed through WASI, adding an interactive graphical front-end, weForth can become a worthy scripting alternative for Web.

### Features
   * supports 32-bit float
   * call interface from FORTH into Javascript functions
   * integrated with Web graphics (SDL2, WebGL) and Physics Engine (Jolt)
   * built-in editor, IDE-style interactive front-end
   * access to ss, dict, and VM memory (via WebAssembly.Memory) from Javascript
   * browser can fetch from self-host web server (i.g. python3 -m http.server)
   * can run parallel in Web Worker threads

### Build - (make sure python3 and Emscripten are installed)
#### Templates
Serving as the core of demos, the templates under ~/template directory are used in different built shown below. They are organized by the Makefile
   * eforth.html  - vanilla weForth, one single-threaded HTML. A good place to start.
   * ceforth.html - weForth, now with integrated editor, single-threaded.
   * weforth.html - weForth runs in a worker thread, can also do fancy GUI stuffs now
       Javascript module/files are included in the HTML for added functionality
       <pre>
       + weforth_helper.js - vocabulary lookup table
       + weforth_worker.js - worker thread proxy object
       + weforth_sleep.js  - sleep/delay support for async environment
       + weforth_logo.js   - Turtle Graphic implementation
       + weforth_jolt.js   - Jolt Physics Engine proxy object
       + file_io.js        - file IO support
       + jolt_core.js      - Jolt + THREE.js implementation
       + jolt_vehicle.js   - Wheeled Vehicle class for simulator
       </pre>

       The following Forth scripts under ~/tests/forth are also included for GUI integration demo
       <pre>
       + forth/logo.fs    - Turtle Graphics
       + forth/jolt.fs    - Jolt Physics Engine
       + forth/shapes.fs  - random Jolt shape generator
       + forth/whisker.fs - Whisker Robots generator
       + forth/vehicle.fs - 2-wheel bikes, and 4-wheel cars generator
       </pre>

### Run on your own box
#### Server-side

    python3 -m http.server
    
#### Client-side Browser

    http://localhost:8000/tests/eforth.html, ceforth.html or weforth.html

### Javascript interface
To communicate between Forth and Javascript engine, weForth implemented a word 'JS' and a function call_js(). They utilize Emscripten EM_JS macro that *postMessage* from C++ backend-side to *onmessage* on browser-side. Depends on your need, handler can be very simple to complicated.

#### in eforth.html and ceforth.html - a simple (and dangerous) handler with the single-threaded demo

    this.onmessage = e=>{
        if (e.data[0]=='js') this.eval(e.data[1])
    }

    > 54321 s" alert('%d ... hello world!')" JS⏎

#### weforth.html - a more complex message dispatcher with the multi-threaded web worker demo

    const ex = (ops)=>Function(       ///< scope limiting eval
        `"use strict"; this.update('${ops}')`
    ).bind(logo)()
    vm.onmessage = e=>{               /// * wait for worker's response
        let k = e.data[0], v = e.data[1]
        switch (k) {
        case 'cmd': to_txt(v);         break
        case 'dc' : show_dict(v);      break
        case 'us' : usr.innerHTML = v; break
        case 'ss' : ss.innerHTML  = v; break
        case 'mm' : mm.innerHTML  = v; ok=1; break
        case 'js' : ex(v);             break
        default: console.log('onmessage.error=>'+e)
        }
    }

### DEBUG the WASM file (dump all functions, check with wasm-objdump in WABT kit)

    make debug
    read tests/ceforth.wasm.txt (really long)

### Benchmark (on my aged IBM X230 w Intel i5-3470@3.2GHz)
Simple 10M tests

Note:
* eForth.js uses JS straight, can do floating-points
* uEforth v7 uses Asm.js, build Forth up with JS "assembly".
* weForth v1 uses token indirected threaded
* weForth+switch(op), is 2x slower than just function pointers.
* weForth v1.2 without yield in nest(), speeds up 3x.
* Emscripten v3.x em++ -O3 => err functions (wa.*) not found, v4.0+ OK
* FireFox v122, is 2x faster than v120
* Chrome is about 10% slower than FireFox
* weForth 4.2 w float32-enabled, runs faster than int32, but why?
* weForth 4.2 w float32/real-time is slower due to message passing
* weForth 4.2 w float32/real-time is even slower without WebGL, why?
